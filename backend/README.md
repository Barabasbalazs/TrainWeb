# Backend for my Train management app

## Local Project Setup

Install all npm packages: npm install

Run the server with node: npm start

The server address will be http://localhost:8080/

## DB access

The utils/constants.js file should contain the pw to my MongoDB Cluster, wich obviously 
I did not push to github.
The password should be set with the value provided by me.
